# caching-stream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jamestalmage/caching-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jamestalmage/caching-stream)

> Keep a copy of streaming data in case the first place you pipe to does not work out.

Provides a pass-through stream that caches a copy of the data in memory to be re-streamed at a later time.
Includes methods to drop the cached data and reclaim the memory once you know you will not need a second copy.

Useful for retries and redirects.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save caching-stream
```

## Usage

```js
var cachingStream = require('caching-stream');

var caching = cachingStream();

caching.pipe(process.stdout);

caching.write('Hello ');
// => "Hello " gets logged to stdout.
 
caching.write('World!');
// => "World" gets logged to stdout.

caching.createCacheStream().pipe(process.stderr);
// => "Hello World!" is piped to stderr.
// cache is immediately emptied to the stream upon creation.

caching.write('Have a nice day!');
// => "Have a nice day!" is piped to both stdout and stderr 

caching.endPassThrough();
// emits "end" event on passThrough chain
// no more data will be written to stdout

caching.write(...); // remaining writes only go to stderr 

caching.dropCache();
// discard cached data
// no effect in this case because `createCacheStream()` has already been called.

caching.dropCache(true); 
// discards any cached data and emits "end" on the cache stream.
// no more data will be piped to the cached stream. 
```

## API

### cached = cachingStream()

Creates a caching stream. It is a `DuplexStream` stream, that has all the events/methods from 
both the `Readable` and `Writable` stream classes. It passes data through unaltered.

#### cached.createCacheStream()
                                    
Returns a `Readable` stream and immediately dumps the full contents of the cache into it.
The cache is immediately discarded to free memory.

#### cached.endPassThrough()

Stops passing data down the passthrough chanel (anything added with `cached.pipe(..)`);

#### cached.dropCache(endCacheStream)

Purges the cache if it exists. If `endCacheStream` is true, it will also trigger the `end`
event on the stream returned from `createCacheStream`.
